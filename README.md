# dbot

For now you can use this bot to roll dice and receive a graph of the probabilities of outcomes for the die roll.

```
Examples:
dice 4d12
dice 2d6
dice 1d13
dice 5d20
```

![There should be an image of a graph here.](https://github.com/mrryyi/dbot/blob/main/docimages/example.png "Title")

Graph is generated in-memory and does not need to be stored to save our precious hardware and time.
